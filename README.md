# Ebola-on-Ethereum
It seems like a bad idea, but let's give it a try.

## Why Ebola?
It was trending in the news at the time when I first had this idea and the public went a little crazy with “ebola fever”; no one was safe. Putting something like the digital version of a virus that caused a some maina on a blockchain that also happened to be causing a disruption seemed like a fun idea.

## Smart Contract Address & ABI
Address:

Contract ABI/JSON Interface:

## Functions
- *“getInfo()”* Returns some basic info of the contract.
- *“getEbola()”* Returns a bit.ly link to the genome file; I’ll get to that later on.
- *“tipCreator()”* Returns my Ether tip address if you’re feeling generous and or amused.
- *“kill()”* The only function the creator has sole access to. This will destroy the contract and send any Ether in the contracts balance back to the creator.

## Expected Result For Functions
