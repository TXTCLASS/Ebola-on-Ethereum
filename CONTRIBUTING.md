### Basic Guidelines
| Do's                                                        | Do Not's                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Properly comment changes and commits.                       | Be an ass (donkey or otherwise).    |
| Explain the issue so anyone (mostly myself) can understand. | Try to submit malicious code (duh). |

### Smart Contract Changes
At this time I'm not in favor of re-deploying the contract unless it's critically in danger, which really shouldn't happen as there is no transactional functionality. 

If the formatting or functions are poorly coded (and my guess is they are), you can make changes to improve the contract hosted on this repo. However, as previously stated the live contract will likely not be re-deployed any time soon.

### App or Other Code Changes
Feel free to improve these in anyway possible within reason. I'm very much a beginner developer and while this code does work I'll assume I've made some amature mistakes all over the place.
